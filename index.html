        <p>Who is luis? I often ask myself this question too. Some days I'm a silly mess and others 
            I'm focused on accomplishing goals. I grew up in West Valley City, Utah, and was raised by two 
            first generation mexican immigrants. I didnt have lots of money or opportunities growing up but I was always 
            taught to work hard to make up for it. I got my first job at 16 and graduated from highschool half a year early. 
            I would love to say I was proud of my work but I had too much ahead of me. I began studying computer engineering at 
            Salt Lake Community College in 2019 where I am still studying. I would love to say im almost done, but since I have 
            worked full time since 16 I've still quite a ways to go. I have learned an intermediate level of JAVA and I'm 
            in a coding bootcamp certified by the University of Utah where I am learning Full-Stack Web Development. I have 
            worked in the tech repair industry, appliance repair industry, Technical Support for an Internet Service Provider, and 
            currently work as a help desk technician for an international company. I had my first son in december of 2022, and I am 
            making strides in my personal and professional life to give him the best life I can. I wish after explaining all that 
            I could say who Luis is, but I think that would discredit who I will be in the future.</p>
